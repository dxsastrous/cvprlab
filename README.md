# CVPR Labs
Hello! I'll be putting lab files here. Feel free to fork the repository.

## Setup
To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies. I'm using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the dependencies and [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage the Python version.
